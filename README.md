# Solving-Ray-Tracing-Equations-with-Neural-Networks
Developed a neural network approach integrating the Hamiltonian method with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to solve ray-tracing equations efficiently. Applied the model to both isotropic and anisotropic media, solving forward and inverse problems in seismic wave propagation.
